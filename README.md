## 🧠 About

This repo is my humble (and slightly painful) journey through **Java Fundamentals** a land of semicolons, curly braces,
and the eternal struggle with the JVM.

Expect to find:

- Code that compiles (eventually)
- Console outputs that question my sanity
- Variables, loops, and a few tears

## 📂 Structure

```

src/
└── edu/
└── umcs/
└── lesson01/
└── lesson02/
└── lesson03/
└── ...
````

Each exercise is a standalone program, runnable straight from IntelliJ.  
No frameworks. No Gradle drama. Just pure, unfiltered Java pain.

---

## 🧪 Running the code

If you dare:

```bash
javac Ex01_PrintName.java
java Ex01_PrintName
````

Or, if you value your sanity:

* Open IntelliJ
* Click the green ▶️
* Pray it works

## 🤡 Developer’s Note

I don’t *hate* Java…
I’m just disappointed.

But hey if this repo saves one poor soul from typing
`System.out.println("Hello World");`
for the 10th time, then it was all worth it.

## 🦥 License

Do whatever you want with this code.
Just don’t make me maintain it.
